    <h1>Installation & Care Instructions</h1>

    <h2>Installation Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        Proper installation is crucial to ensure the longevity and aesthetic appeal of your Classic Impressions pieces. 
        We recommend the following steps for a successful installation:
        • Surface Preparation: Ensure that the surface is clean, dry, and free from dust or grease. 
        • Adhesive Selection: Use a high-quality construction adhesive suitable for the material of your piece and the substrate.
        • Positioning: Dry-fit the piece to determine the best placement before applying adhesive.
        • Application: Apply adhesive evenly to the back of the piece and press firmly into place. 
        Use temporary supports if necessary until the adhesive cures.
        • Curing Time: Allow adequate curing time as per the adhesive manufacturer's instructions before handling or painting.

    <h2>Care and Maintenance</h2>
    <p>
        To maintain the beauty and integrity of your Classic Impressions pieces, follow these care guidelines:
        • Regular Dusting: Use a soft, dry cloth or a feather duster to remove dust regularly.
        • Cleaning: For more thorough cleaning, use a damp cloth with mild soap and water. Avoid abrasive cleaners or solvents.
        • Avoid Moisture: While our materials are durable, prolonged exposure to moisture can affect finishes. 
        Wipe off any spills immediately.
        • Touch-Ups: For minor scratches or chips, contact our customer service for advice on touch-up kits or professional refinishing services.
