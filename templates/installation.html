      <h3>Preserving Your Investment</h3>
      <p>
        The pieces in the Classic Impressions collection are designed for seamless integration 
        into sophisticated architectural environments. We have engineered our products to 
        facilitate installation by skilled tradesmen and to require minimal, simple maintenance.

      <h3>Care and Maintenance</h3>
      <p>
        Our durable finishes are sealed for protection and designed to be virtually maintenance-free.
        <ul>
            <li>
              Cleaning: To clean your Classic Impressions piece, simply use a soft, dry, lint-free cloth or a feather duster.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stubborn Marks: If necessary, a slightly dampened cloth (water only) may be used very gently. Avoid all abrasive 
              cleaners, harsh chemicals (like ammonia or bleach), and solvents, as these can damage the protective sealant 
              and the integrity of the hand-applied patina.
            </li>
            <li>
              Environment: Our products are designed for interior, and exterior usage.
            </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          By following these simple guidelines, your architectural elements will retain their unique character and 
          sophisticated Classic Impression for decades.

          Our lightweight yet durable composite structure simplifies handling compared to solid stone or metal.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Integrated Mounting: Structural pieces (Corbels, Niches, Pediments) are supplied with integrated mounting points 
              (e.g., keyholes or pre-drilled brackets) designed for secure attachment to studs or structural blocking.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adhesion for Reliefs: Decorative reliefs and appliqués (Cartouches, Emblems) can be securely attached 
              using a high-quality structural adhesive (such as construction-grade epoxy or polyurethane adhesive) 
              appropriate for both the product and the substrate material (e.g., drywall, wood, masonry).
            </li>
            <li>
              Professional Recommendation: We strongly recommend that all complex or permanent architectural 
              pieces be installed by a qualified professional (e.g., licensed contractor, carpenter, or millworker) 
              to ensure safe, secure, and perfectly level placement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finishing at Seams: For built-in elements like niches or large corbels, minor seams between 
              the product and the wall can be professionally finished using a non-shrinking, paintable filler 
              or caulk before the final wall paint is applied.
            </li>
          </ul>
