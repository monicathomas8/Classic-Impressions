  <h1>Craftsmanship</h1>
  <h2>The Foundation of Quality</h2>
  <p>
        The enduring beauty of a Classic Impressions piece is rooted in the quality of its 
        components and the precision of its finish. We utilize advanced materials and traditional 
        hand-finishing techniques to ensure every ornament retains the sharpest detail while offering superior durability.
  </p>

  <h2>Materials That Stand the Test of Time</h2>
  <p>
        All our decorative pieces are cast using a proprietary High-Density Architectural Composite resin. 
        This material is chosen specifically for its unique advantages in producing fine architectural detail:
        • Exceptional Detail Retention: The low-shrink nature of the composite perfectly captures the intricate undercuts 
        and delicate lines of the original master carvings, providing an unmatched fidelity to classical form.
        • Durability and Stability: Unlike traditional plaster or gypsum, our composite is highly resistant
        to chipping, cracking, and moisture damage. It is dimensionally stable, making it ideal 
        for installation in diverse interior environments.
        • Versatile Weight: Engineered to provide a satisfying, substantial feel without the prohibitive 
        weight of solid stone or metal, simplifying installation while maintaining a sense of luxury.
  </p>

    <h2>Hand-Finished Excellence</h2>
    <p>
        Our Signature Finishes: Applied by Hand.
        The final "Impression" is achieved through a multi-stage, hand-applied finishing process.
    </p>

    <h3>The Patinated Bronze Collection</h3>
    <p>
        This is the finish that defines our brand, offering the noble, 
        aged elegance of a foundry piece without the cost or corrosive effects of real metal.
        • The Foundation: Each piece is treated with an initial metal-powder base coat.
        • The Patina: Our artisans meticulously apply a series of washes, glazes, 
        and dry-brush techniques to mimic the natural oxidation and wear of genuine bronze over decades.
        • Sealed for Permanence: The finish is cured and sealed with a protective layer, 
        ensuring color fastness and easy maintenance, allowing the piece to retain its rich lustre for years to come.
    </p>
    <h3>The Bespoke Finishes</h3>
    <p>
        In addition to our signature bronze, we offer specialist finishes crafted 
        to integrate seamlessly into any design scheme, including:
        • Aged Limestone: A textural, matte finish mimicking centuries-old carved stone.
        • Verdigris Copper: A vibrant, oxidized green-blue patina for a dramatic, antique effect.
        • Faux Marble: Expertly veined and polished to replicate the appearance of Carrara or Statuario marble.
