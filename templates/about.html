    <h3>The Foundation of Quality</h3>
    <p>
        The enduring beauty of a Classic Impressions piece is rooted in the quality of its
        components and the precision of its finish. We utilize advanced materials and traditional
        hand-finishing techniques to ensure every ornament retains the sharpest detail while offering superior
        durability.

    <h3>Materials That Stand the Test of Time</h3>
    <p>
        All our decorative pieces are cast using a proprietary High-Density Architectural Composite resin.
        This material is chosen specifically for its unique advantages in producing fine architectural detail
    <ul>
        <li>
            Exceptional Detail Retention: The low-shrink nature of the composite perfectly captures the intricate
            undercuts
            and delicate lines of the original master carvings, providing an unmatched fidelity to classical form.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightweight Strength: Our composite is engineered to be significantly lighter than traditional materials
            like stone or metal, facilitating easier handling and installation without compromising structural
            integrity.
        </li>
        <li>
            Eco-Friendly Composition: The composite is manufactured with sustainability in mind, utilizing recycled
            content and non-toxic components wherever possible.
        </li>
        <li>
            Durability and Stability: Unlike traditional plaster or gypsum, our composite is highly resistant
            to chipping, cracking, and moisture damage. It is dimensionally stable, making it ideal
            for installation in diverse interior environments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Versatile Weight: Engineered to provide a satisfying, substantial feel without the prohibitive
            weight of solid stone or metal, simplifying installation while maintaining a sense of luxury.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hand-Finished Excellence</h3>
    <p>
        Our Signature Finishes: Applied by Hand.
        The final "Impression" is achieved through a multi-stage, hand-applied finishing process.
    </p>
    <h4>The Patinated Bronze Collection</h4>
    <p>
        This is the finish that defines our brand, offering the noble,
        aged elegance of a foundry piece without the cost or corrosive effects of real metal.
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Foundation: Each piece is treated with an initial metal-powder base coat.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Patina: Our artisans meticulously apply a series of washes, glazes,
            and dry-brush techniques to mimic the natural oxidation and wear of genuine bronze over decades.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sealed for Permanence: The finish is cured and sealed with a protective layer,
            ensuring color fastness and easy maintenance, allowing the piece to retain its rich lustre for years to
            come.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>The Bespoke Finishes</h4>
    <p>
        In addition to our signature bronze, we offer specialist finishes crafted
        to integrate seamlessly into any design scheme, including:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Aged Limestone: A textural, matte finish mimicking centuries-old carved stone.
            <li>
                Verdigris Copper: A vibrant, oxidized green-blue patina for a dramatic, antique effect.
            </li>
            <li>
                Faux Marble: Expertly veined and polished to replicate the appearance of Carrara or Statuario marble.
            </li>
        </ul>
