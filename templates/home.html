    <h2>The Art of Architectural Detail</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Classic Impressions, where we believe that true elegance lies in the details.
        In an era of streamlined design, we are devoted to the enduring beauty, proportion, and artistry of classical architecture.
        
        For centuries, elements like the cartouche, the corbel, and the decorative niche have transformed interiors from simple spaces into distinguished, 
        storytelling environments. These are not merely ornaments; they are the vocabulary of lasting design.

        At Classic Impressions, we painstakingly recreate these masterpieces. Our dedication to authenticity ensures that every line, curve, 
        and relief you find in this collection reflects the mastery of the great historical periods, from the Baroque flourish to the restraint of Neoclassicism.
